# Zyfra Project
This company is engaged in developing efficient solutions for heavy industry. Prepare a machine learning model prototype for Zyfra. The model created must be able to predict the amount of gold extracted or obtained from gold ore. There is data available regarding the gold ore extraction and refining process that can be used.

## Objective
It is hoped that this model will help create a more efficient production process and eliminate parameters that do not produce profits.

## Things that need to be done:
- Prepare available data
- Run data analysis
- Develop and train models
